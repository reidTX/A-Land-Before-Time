Inspiration

Stemming off the 2024 RowdyHacks theme of dinosaurs our team created the game A Land Before Time to allow players to enjoy an entertaining and easy-going game. We wanted to create a game that allowed the player to test their cognitive reflexes and dino knowledge while they attempt to capture photos of different dinosaurs in a limited amount of time. We hope that this game can test your dino knowledge and be fun at the same time. Meanwhile, we also wanted to stray away from the classic identification gameplay loop of identifying fossils and focus on the actual living creatures to create an intriguing experience.

What it does

Our game allows people of all ages to view dinosaurs in a first-person point of view. The game is a low poly 3D game where the goal is to score as many points as possible within one minute. Scoring points can be accomplished by the character taking photos of dinosaurs with their camera. There will be dinosaurs that are rare and/or smaller that will be worth more points! The dinosaurs are also in their own assigned habitats such as a Swamp, Deserts, Forests, and Mountains. If the player wishes to see which dinosaurs are in the game they can see this at the end of the game in which they are categorized and shown by their habitats.

How we built it

We built this project with only three softwares/languages, we used Unity, c#, and Blender to build this project. We used Blender to make some models for the game such as the dome we have in our game and some other basic shapes. Then we also used Unity along with C# to complete the entire rest of the project.

Challenges we ran into

One of the challenges we faced was how the character would view and take pictures of the dinosaurs without getting attacked, as they are predatory creatures and we aren't Chris Pratt. Therefore, we decided to include a dome to allow the player to walk around in the dome and view the different sections of the map where the dinosaurs roam.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are very proud to have a fully finished game with different menus and scenes. We are very happy that even though our game is small there are still so many avenues that we can improve upon. Leaving ourselves with a project that can be elevated higher makes us feel very accomplished.

What we learned

We learned how to work fast and efficiently and not dream too big and fall short. We started off with the idea of a small but finished game and we learned that when we focus and manage time wisely we were able to accomplish our goals.

What's next for A land before time

A little bit of polishing will be needed! The game was created in 24hrs and of course, is not perfect as nothing ever is. However, our team will continue to add more dinosaurs and larger challenges to the game to make it even more competitive for the player in the future. We also hope to be able to add a book of all the dinosaurs that the player has taken a picture of. We also hope to add an indicator for the player on which dinosaur they are currently looking at.
